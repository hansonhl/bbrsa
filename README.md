# Batch and Beam RSA (BBRSA)

Implementation of the Rational Speech Acts model, using efficient beam search and batched methods, inspired by the OpenNMT framework.

## Prerequisites
To use opennmt models, clone the OpenNMT repository locally. As exemplified in main.py and main2.py, add the line ```sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(<LOCAL_ONMT_PATH>))``` before `import onmt`.
