    "The following are some examples of what the Bert Distractor generates for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the method is to get a heuristic measure of saliency for each word from BERT's outputs. Then I pick 5 most salient words in the sentence according to that measure (excluding the beginning `[CLS]` and ending `[SEP]` tokens), mask all words using the `[MASK]` token, and let BERT predict a word for these masked positions as distractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there are two possible heuristic measures: \n",
    "  - the summed up and normalized attention given by the layer-0 transformer in BERT, this one is by default.\n",
    "  - the negative log probability for each source word given by BERT's language model, with the source article with out any mask as input. Use this heuristic by specifying `method='unmasked_surprisal'` in the `generate()` method of the distractor\n",
    "    \n",
    "Also I force the distractor to choose a different word if BERT predicts the same word as before for a masked position. This can be disabled in specifying the keyword argument `ensure_different=False` in the `generate()` method."
